						<p>Allen Center, a 3.1 million-square-foot office complex, is located in the downtown Houston Central Business District and comprised of Allen Center One, Two, and Three. Originally, this area was considered to be an eastern portion of the Fourth Ward. However, with the opening of Interstate 45 in the 1950s, this portion became separated from the rest of the Fourth Ward, becoming a part of downtown Houston and eventually the Allen Center.<br>
						<br>
						Allen Center One is located on 500 Dallas Street, built in 1972, and renovated in 1992. It is designed by Wilson Morris Crain & Anderson. This building is a 34-story rectangular commercial office tower with a typical floor size of 27,000 square feet. Allen Center Two, located on 1200 Smiths Street, is designed by a different firm named Lloyd Jones Brewer & Associates, AIA in 1978 and renovated in 1992. It is a 36-story rectangular office tower with a typical floor size of 26,613 square feet. Allen Center Three is completed by the same architecture firm Lloyd Jones Brewer & Associates in 1983, 5 years after they designed the Allen Center Two. It is located on 333 Clay Street, on the west of the Allen Center One and Allen Center Two. It is a 50-story irregular octagonal office tower, making it the 12th tallest building in Houston at the time, with a typical floor area of 25,000 square feet.<br></p>

						<p>Working within a series or a sequence is interesting. In a series, there are individual components that belong to a single set but each part relies on the previous one while anticipating the next. The idea of an “architectural center” is also worth exploring its true meaning in the architectural context. As a result, the site be selected for this thesis project is the Allen Center Complex in downtown Houston, comprised of three office buildings: Allen Center One, Two, and Three. </p>

						<h6>above, unfolded diagram analysis</h6>
						<p>While considering designing the NEXT building in a series of design, there are different scenerios. The NEXT building could be exactly the copy of previous one or the collage of previous two. The NEXT building could also switch its form to a plinth or a tunnel to connected the lower levels of the previous buildings, which could be easily found in the real world. There is also another scenerio that the NEXT could be transformed as a “drapery”, a canopy that deals with in-between space and smoothly unifies the previous buildings. </p>

						<h6>above, concept diagrams</h6>
						<p>Allen Center Four is primarily made from two forms: a vault form at the ground level and a roof canopy. The form of the canopy is derived from peeling off the facades of the exisitng Allen Center buildings to connect to each other. This peeling and joining create a unified form to mediate the strange-ness of the existing Allen Center forms.<br>
						<br>
						In order to find the natural form, a series a chain test is performed. Chains are anchored at the points of the Allen Center buildings and are allowed to drape under their own gravity.<br></p>

						<p>While the original office buildign programs are kept to maintain the building identity, new programs are introduced for the in-between area. There is no central core within the in-between area. There are ramps leading visitors into public programs such as the lobby, the fitness or conference center but to get an upper private area, visitors must enter in from the existing buildings and use the existing cores.<br>
						<br>
						The vault creates an interaction of a curved form to the ground shared between the three buildings. It provides a unified covered outdoor space, allowing more commercial  programs to occur on the ground level.<br></p>
